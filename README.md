Project Question: Can we confirm the results of the original study and find differences in transcriptomes of the anterior cingulate cortex between patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and control patients?

Are there any differences between the RNA-sequenced transcriptomes in the nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex, or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, major depression, or bipolar disorder and control patients?
